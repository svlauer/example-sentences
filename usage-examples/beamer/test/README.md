# Beamer integration test files

The files in this direction mainly serve as test cases for the interplay of `example_sentences` with the `beamer` package.

For examples of the recommended usage of `beamer` with `example_sentences`, see the files in [the `usage-examples/beamer` directory](usage-examples/beamer).
